  <h1>My Notes</h1>
  <p>Here I will leave some personal records.</p><br>

  <h3>6/26</h3>
  <p>To get a little more used to it, I decided to add a new note to my homepage.</p>
  <p>Today, I'm going to work on the initial sketch for my newillustration.</p>

  <h3>12/25</h3>
  <p>I came back to work on this homepage after a long time.</p>
  <p>However, I had forgotten many things and there were many parts I didn't understand, so it was more difficult than I expected.</p>
